## Linux ##

After using KDE for a couple of years, I felt guilty about not contributing my programming skills (or lack thereof) to the open-source community.  Q7Z was my first step towards silencing this feeling.  I loved Python and thought Qt4 applications looked great, so PyQt4 was the obvious choice.

## Windows ##

At the time, I was still working as a software engineer in Windows most days.  Without much fuss, I ported Q7Z across to Windows.  It unfortunately required bulky libraries, so I decided to port the Python code across to C# .NET for increased nativity.  The resultant application was #7Z.
